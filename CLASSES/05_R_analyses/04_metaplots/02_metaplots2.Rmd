Goal: to use profile_tss to make metaplots of how each of DBPs
bind across promoter windows (+/- 1Kb). We will further cluster 
the DBPs by their binding profiles. Previously we clustered by 
similarity of WHICH promoters were bound -- now we are determining 
similarity of how the bind across the promoter.

Exercise in 01_metaplots.Rmd was to create a function that makes 
a metaplot of binding events (peak overlaps) across each position of 
a promoter window. The solution is basically to copy and paste the code
into "util/my_class_functions.R" 

I called the function -> "profile_tss()" so will create a metaplot for any 
dbp provided and the ChIPseq peak coordinates!


# Loading in data created in the environmnet of 01_peak_features. 
```{r import genome features & file list}

# loading in needed files from 01_peak_features
load("../01_peak_features/results/peak_features.RData", verbose = T)

```

# we could generate each plot individually to save them
profile_tss is the same as the code we ran in 01_metaplots.Rmd.
Let's see how handy this function is now!
```{r individual meta plots}

# MAX
plot(profile_tss(consensus_peaks[["MAX"]], lncrna_mrna_promoters))

# 
plot(profile_tss(consensus_peaks[["BRCA1"]], lncrna_mrna_promoters))

# H3K36me3
plot(profile_tss(consensus_peaks[["H3K36me3"]], lncrna_mrna_promoters))

# H3K4me3
plot(profile_tss(consensus_peaks[["JUN"]], lncrna_mrna_promoters))

# HDAC2
plot(profile_tss(consensus_peaks[["POLR2A"]], lncrna_mrna_promoters))

# RCOR1
plot(profile_tss(consensus_peaks[["TBP"]], lncrna_mrna_promoters))

# REST
plot(profile_tss(consensus_peaks[["POLR2AphosphoS2"]], lncrna_mrna_promoters))

plot(profile_tss(consensus_peaks[["POLR2AphosphoS5"]], lncrna_mrna_promoters))


```
Cool that works but what if we had 480 DBPs as we will soon
--> NO FUN
However we can make a handy for loop to do this for us !

# Running profile TSS function across consensus peaks
NOTE THIS TAKES awhile to run !
When we move to all DBPs (480) it can take 4 hours !

```{r creating coverage matrix for all DBPs }

# Let's now run this for all off the DBPs and compile it into one data frame.
# Let's first define an empty data.frame to which we can row_bind each new one created.
# We are adding one new col called dbp as we extract this in the forloop
metaplot_df <- data.frame(x = integer(), dens = numeric(), dbp = character())

# refresh what the output of profile_tss is:
test <- profile_tss(consensus_peaks[["HDAC2"]], lncrna_mrna_promoters)

# Writting a for loop to calculate promoter coverage for all consensus_peaks:
for(i in 1:length(consensus_peaks)) {
  print(names(consensus_peaks)[[i]])
  tmp_df <- profile_tss(consensus_peaks[[i]], lncrna_mrna_promoters)
  tmp_df$dbp <- names(consensus_peaks)[[i]]
  metaplot_df <- bind_rows(metaplot_df, tmp_df)
  
}

# Take a look at metaplot df should be length: nDBPs * 2000

# write_rds(metaplot_df, "metaplot_df.rds")
write_rds(metaplot_df, "results/metaplot_df_final.rds")

```


# Now let's make some meta plots and cluster them!
We are starting with our denisty matrix of peaks overlapping
each base in the +/- 1Kb window around TSS of lncrna and mrna promoters

We will then cluster it by patterns/correlations in the metaplot 
```{r Clustering META_PLOTS}
# read in metaplot_df
metaplot_df <- read_rds("results/metaplot_df_final.rds")
# metaplot_df <- read_rds("metaplot_df.rds")

# PIVOT WIDER
# into a matrix for correlation analysis of patterns
# This is the correlation across rows now
# X = position
# dens = denisty at position
# -> cols become position -values dens

metaplot_filtered_matrix <- metaplot_df %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = x, values_from = dens) %>%
  column_to_rownames("dbp") %>%
  as.matrix()

# Let's see how many have NA values
table(rowSums(is.na(metaplot_filtered_matrix)))

# If there are any NAs Let's filter out those is.na
metaplot_filtered_matrix <- metaplot_filtered_matrix[rowSums(is.na(metaplot_filtered_matrix)) == 0,]

# Z-Scale the rows for clustering (not needed for profile plots)
mm_scaled <- t(scale(t(metaplot_filtered_matrix)))

# clustering
metaplot_hclust <- hclust(dist(mm_scaled), method = "complete")

# plotting
plot(metaplot_hclust)

# Plot the dendrogram
pdf("figures/tss_profile_dendrogram.pdf", height = 10, width = 27)
par(cex=0.3)
plot(metaplot_hclust)
dev.off()
```
Result: Here I see RCOR1 and REST are similar as 
perhaps expected since they function together. 

Result: Enhancer marks (EP300) correlate with K4me3 and
HDAC2. HDAC2 is a bit odd since it is typically thought to 
repress gene activity.

Result: K2me3 is repressive and K36me3 is active. So a bit 
suprising that they corrlate. Could be due to being in genebodies 
more than promoters.

# Let's dig deeper into clustering 
We can set the number of clusters 
to group into smaller groups etc.

```{r Subsetting cluster numbers}
# Cut the tree to make some clusters 
# let's start with 4 since that is how many i have
# change to how many your have - 3
clusters <- cutree(metaplot_hclust, k=4)
table(clusters)

```
Result: I see that one cluster has three DBPs most have 1
and cluster 4 has 2. Let's make a heatmap to investigate further.

# Making a heatmap of subclusters binding density patterns.

```{r Subsetting cluster numbers}
# Let's make a heatmap now.
col_fun <- colorRamp2(c(-3, 0, 3), c("#5980B3", "#ffffff", "#B9605D"))
split <- data.frame(split = c(rep("-1kb",1000), rep("+1kb", 1000)))

# pdf("figures/tss_profile_heatmap.pdf", height = 35, width = 10)
Heatmap(mm_scaled, cluster_columns = FALSE, col = col_fun, border = TRUE, 
        show_column_names = FALSE,
        use_raster = TRUE,
        column_split = split,
        column_gap = unit(0, "mm"),row_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 7))
# dev.off()

# Now a heatmap with only cluster 1 since it has the most dbps (3).
Heatmap(mm_scaled[clusters == 1,], cluster_columns = FALSE, col = col_fun, border = TRUE, 
        show_column_names = FALSE,
        use_raster = TRUE,
        column_split = split,
        column_gap = unit(0, "mm"),row_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 7))
par(cex = 1)

```
Result: RCOR1, REST, EP300, HDAC2, K4me3 all bind around TSS
Result: H3K27me3 and H3K36 are more in gene bodies and depleted at TSS.



#  Metaplots seperated by lncRNA and mRNA promoters
The above strategy works just fine, however we would have to make
a lot of plots if there were 480dbps in our dataset -- which there will be :)
So a second strategy is to:

(1) run the for loop for lncrna and mrna separately
(2) add a column that has lncrna or mrna for plotting seperate
(3) merge them and then facet wrap the figure into each dbp 

Let's try it !


```{r making seperate metaplots for lncRNAs and mRNAs}

# making promoters (should already be loaded but just to be safe)
lncrna_promoters <- lncrna_mrna_promoters[lncrna_mrna_promoters$gene_type == "lncRNA"]
mrna_promoters <- lncrna_mrna_promoters[lncrna_mrna_promoters$gene_type == "protein_coding"]

#setting up lncrna DF.
lncrna_metaplot_df <- data.frame(x = integer(), dens = numeric(), dbp = character())

# for loop to populate DF with overlap density in lncrna promoters

for(i in 1:length(consensus_peaks)) {
  print(names(consensus_peaks)[[i]])
  tmp_df <- profile_tss(consensus_peaks[[i]], lncrna_mrna_promoters = lncrna_promoters)
  tmp_df$dbp <- names(consensus_peaks)[[i]]
  lncrna_metaplot_df <- bind_rows(lncrna_metaplot_df, tmp_df)
  
}

# now for mRNAs 
mrna_metaplot_df <- data.frame(x = integer(), dens = numeric(), dbp = character())

for(i in 1:length(consensus_peaks)) {
  print(names(consensus_peaks)[[i]])
  tmp_df <- profile_tss(consensus_peaks[[i]], lncrna_mrna_promoters = mrna_promoters)
  tmp_df$dbp <- names(consensus_peaks)[[i]]
  mrna_metaplot_df <- bind_rows(mrna_metaplot_df, tmp_df)
  
}

# now adding the information of gene type
mrna_metaplot_df$gene_type <- "mRNA"
lncrna_metaplot_df$gene_type <- "lncRNA"
combined_metaplot_profile <- bind_rows(mrna_metaplot_df, lncrna_metaplot_df)

# plotting - NOTE facet wrap by dbp !
ggplot(combined_metaplot_profile, 
       aes(x = x, y = dens, color = gene_type )) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.5) + 
  facet_wrap(dbp ~ ., scales = "free_y") +
  
  
  ggtitle("Combined Promoter Metaplot") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-1000, 0, 1000),
                     labels = c("-1kb", "TSS", "+1kb"),
                     name = "") + 
  ylab("Peak frequency") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#424242","#a8404c"))

```
Result: H3K27me3 looks almost inverse between lncrna and mrna
Result: Most look similar on lncrna and mrna promoters - 
despite different profiles for different dbps

# alternative strategy: lncrna and mrna metaplots individually
here we will run profile TSS for lncrna and mrna seperately
we will do this for each dbp indvidually.

```{r making seperate metaplots for lncRNAs and mRNAs}

# creating promoters just in case:
lncrna_promoters <- lncrna_mrna_promoters[lncrna_mrna_promoters$gene_type == "lncRNA"]
mrna_promoters <- lncrna_mrna_promoters[lncrna_mrna_promoters$gene_type == "protein_coding"]

# Now we can use plot profile_tss with lncrna and mrna promoters
# HDAC2 / feel free to pick any other gene
lncrna_metaplot <- profile_tss(consensus_peaks[["HDAC2"]], lncrna_promoters)
mrna_metaplot <- profile_tss(consensus_peaks[["HDAC2"]], mrna_promoters)

# now make a new column that has mrna and lncrna
# we can color the plot by this col.
# we then bind the two matrices with "bind_rows"
mrna_metaplot$gene_type <- "mRNA"
lncrna_metaplot$gene_type <- "lncRNA"
combined_metaplot_profile <- bind_rows(mrna_metaplot, lncrna_metaplot)

# plotting
ggplot(combined_metaplot_profile, 
       aes(x = x, y = dens, color = gene_type)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.5) + 
  ggtitle("HDAC2 Promoter Metaplot") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-1000, 0, 1000),
                     labels = c("-1kb", "TSS", "+1kb"),
                     name = "") + 
  ylab("Peak frequency") +
 scale_color_manual(values = c("#424242","#a8404c"))

# combinig on the same plot shows the difference in binding !
```
Result: HDAC2 has similar binding patterns on mrna and lncrna promoters!
