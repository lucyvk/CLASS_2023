Goal: Grab RNAseq from the internet, use the download to create sample sheet and 
design file we need to run RNAseq NF_CORE pipeline.

# sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness
https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/usage

We almost always use a sample sheet in downstream analyses. The basic info can be really helpful for making groups and doing comparisons on those groups etc. So here we
will create a sample sheet that we can use for our analyses and design file for input into NF_CORE RNAseq pipeline.

Thus we can use our encode_file_info function to both retreive data and 
create sample_sheet and design file right from that code. Thus our design and samplesheet will be 100% reproducible! The modern NF_CORE RNAseq pipelines require this information in design file:


FIRST, we need to learn a really awesome and powerful function called "MAP" in the "PURR" package.

# Introduction to map
Since one encode experimental accession has multiple files we can "MAP" 
all the files to a single entry for each experiment accession. This would 
be similar to putting a bunch of file paths in one excel "cell" Let's start with the basics of MAP.

# Using MAP
```{r MAP example}

# In this example we'll take the digits 1 through 10 and "map" each to the rnorm function. 
map_example <- 1:10 %>%
  map(rnorm, n = 1000) 

# It returns a nested list, let's look:
summary(map_example)

# Let's look with table
table(summary(map_example))

# let's index and look
map_example[[1]]

hist(map_example[[1]])

# another one
map_example[[2]]

hist(map_example[[2]])

# indexing to the first component of map vector
map_example[[1]][[1]]

```

# MAP encode_file_info function output to sample_sheet

We can use map to call this encode_file_info function for each experiment accession
and return each experimental_accession as an entry in a data.frame 
Specifically one row associated with experiment acession (ENCSR) will have all the encode files (ENCFF)

So one row will have many files in it -- similar to have a bunch of files in a single excel "cell". First let's read in the RNAseq samples we downloaded from ENCODE.

```{r reading in sample sheet}

# We'll also rename this Accession column to clarify between experiment_accession and file_accession.
samples <- read.table("data/samples.txt",
                      sep = "\t", skip = 1, header = T) %>%
  dplyr::rename(experiment_accession = Accession) 

# It's seems mundane but starting here is the best way to make a "reproducible" sample sheet.
# Bottom line: the download to code to analysis is the way to reproducibility (this worked a year later :)

# If you don't already have the samples.txt you can get it here:

# wget -O samples.txt "https://www.encodeproject.org/report.tsv?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_slims=Transcription&assay_slims=Transcription&replicates.library.biosample.donor.organism.scientific_name=Homo+sapiens&biosample_ontology.term_name=HepG2&biosample_ontology.classification=cell+line&assay_title=total+RNA-seq&files.read_length=50&limit=all&advancedQuery=date_released:[2009-01-01%20TO%202021-12-31]"

# sample site to get report:

```

# Mapping each experiment to the experiment_accession

Each experiment accession has multiple files associated with the accession
Let's use map to map each experiment to it's experiment accession and clean up sample sheet

```{r MAP to experiment_accession}

?mutate
?map

# We are making a new column in samples called file_info. This is created
# by mapping experiment_accession and putting the variable through encode_file_info function.
# This will map the information (8 fields) retrieved by encode_file_info function by 
# experiment_accession in a column called file_info.

samples <- samples %>%
  # note function inside a function being called.
  # the "experiment_acession" col will be read into encode_file_info function
  # ~ means pass the experiment_accession value into encode_file_info
  # (.x) is a generic symbol meaning pass what is in memory == experiment_accession
  mutate(file_info = map(experiment_accession, ~ encode_file_info(.x)))

# Thus for each accession in experiment_accession mutate will use the function MAP
# to map each experimental file to the "file_info" column and keep the data there.

```

# Unnesting the data from MAP
This is a bit hard to read in this format, so we can unnest the data.frames in the file_info column using the unnest command.
This will duplicate the remaining columns to match the number of lines in the nested data.frame.

```{r unnesting MAP}

?unnest
# This function will extract the mapped info and make new cols and rows
# We also need to tell it which column we want to unnest.

# note samples is currently 5 rows
samples <- samples %>%
  unnest(cols = file_info)
# Now samples is 20 rows from unnesting the 5 previous rows.
# This is because each experimental accession had 4 files for 5 exp accession = 20 rows

```

# creating replicate number
# rep number and sample_id col changes
Now we have all the information we neeed in this data.frame and we just need to clean it up.

```{r sample sheet curration: adding replicate number for each RNAseq experiment}
# Let's number our replicates and create a new column called sample id 
# where we join the experiment accesion and the rep number

samples <- samples %>%
  group_by(experiment_accession) %>%
  mutate(rep_number = as.numeric(factor(replicate))) %>%
  unite(sample_id, experiment_accession, rep_number, sep = "_rep", remove = F)

 # unite will make a new column in samples (piped in) called sample_id
  # here we will combine experiment accession and rep number with _rep in between
  # This is a handy handle for the data to access later
```

# Cleaning up: getting rid of non essential data
Now let's get rid of all that data we don't need! 

```{r removing data from sample sheet}

# We're just selecting a subset of columns from samples with dplyr::select
samples <- samples %>%
   dplyr::select(accession, sample_id, experiment_accession, Assay.title,
                Biosample.summary, md5sum, paired_end_identifier) %>%
  
  # here we are going to start to build the fastq file name for NF_core input
  unite(fastq_file, sample_id, paired_end_identifier, sep = "_read", remove = F)

# Now we have a new col fastq_file with the information for each fastq file
# We will keep adding to this until we get to the final NF_Core input file name.
```

# Setting up filename for NF_CORE rnaseq pipeline
Now let's make the full filename for the fastq files. 
For the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline, the paired-end reads need to be named 
with the read number in the filename. 

```{r filename for NF_CORE rnaseq pipeline: adding .fastq.gz to fastq_file}

# We are now making a new column with .fastq.gz extension and then unite to make fastq file name.

samples <- samples %>%
  mutate(fq_extension = ".fastq.gz") %>%
  unite(fastq_file, fastq_file, fq_extension, sep = "", remove = F) %>%
  
  # This original file column will be used along with the new name column to rename the fastq files.
  unite(original_file, accession, fq_extension, sep = "")

# nice we see a fastq file column and can be used as input into NF_CORE
```


# renaming fastq files to fit sample sheet
This cleaned up version of the samplesheet is good to go!
Now we want to rename the fastq files to the fastq name we just made.

```{r rename fastq files to samplesheet id}
# Rename the fastq files so that they contain the sample ID.
rename_script <- samples %>%
  # removes grouping in samples
  ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(fastq_file, original_file) %>%
  mutate(command = "mv") %>%
  unite(command, command, original_file, fastq_file, sep = " ")
# The result of this is that each row is a bash command.
```

# run rename script
# NOTE : MAKE SURE TO MOVE TO FASTQ FOLDER TO RUN THIS
# cd /data/fastq/
```{r rename fastq files to samplesheet id}
# We can write this out as a bash script with ?write_lines 
# We include a shebang header line so that the script is interpreted by bash.
?write_lines

write_lines(c("#!/bin/bash", rename_script$command), "rename.sh")
# Now cd fastq and "chmod u+x rename.sh
# then ./rename.sh

# >>> voila all the files are renamed
```

# md5sum check on file downloads
Additionally from all of this information we've gathered we can create a text file to run the md5sum check.

```{r md5sum of fastq}
# Let's create an md5.txt to run the checksums
# We will use the same approach for the mv script.

md5 <- samples %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(md5sum, fastq_file) %>%
  # note double space for md5 requirements 
  unite(line, md5sum, fastq_file, sep = "  ")

# writting out md5$line col that has the command in it from above.
write_lines(md5$line, "md5.txt")

# Now let's run it from R to BASH with "system()" function
# NOTE THIS TAKES A FEW MINUTES 
md5_results <- system("md5sum -c md5.txt")

# NOTE that we changed the file name but this isn't checked by md5sum
 
```
NICE all files are documented as properly downloaded (towards that 100% reproducible factor)


# finalizing sample sheet for NF_CORE

Finally, we can write out a nicely formatted sample sheet 
that we will use downstream for further analysis of the read counts in R.

```{r Reorganizing to make a sample sheet for DEseq2}
# Let's create the sample sheet that we will use later
# to do the RNA-seq analysis in R.

samples <- samples %>%
  dplyr::rename(fastq = fastq_file,
                seq_type = Assay.title,
                sample_name = Biosample.summary) %>%
  # The minus sign will remove this column -- which we no longer need.
  dplyr::select(-original_file) 

```

# Reducing samples > sample sheet
# Final Sample Sheet !

Now that we have it cleaned up, let's create one line for each replicate
where the fastq read 1 and read 2 are in the same row.
```{R organizing samplesheet }
# For this next step we will use the pivot wider function
# We need to tell the pivot_wider function which unique column combinations will specify each new row. 

# PIVOT WIDER by "paired_end_identifier" 
samplesheet <- samples %>%
  #id_cols is a parameter in pivot wider to select the cols
  # the paired end identifier becomes the "marienette" string of the data-frame.
  # There are two values and thus all the current cols will be split into 2 (one for each pe-id)
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c("sample_id", "seq_type", "sample_name"),
              names_from = paired_end_identifier,
              values_from = c("fastq", "md5sum"))


# Cleaning up sample sheet (removing spaces - re-arrange etc)
samplesheet <- samplesheet %>%
# cleaning up column "sample_name" that has spaces in it to replace with underscore
mutate(condition = gsub(" ", "_", sample_name) %>% tolower()) %>%
# splitting up "sample_id" to extract replicate number (by "_" )
separate(sample_id, into = c("experiment_accession", "replicate"), 
           remove = FALSE, sep = "_") %>%
# replicate col values came from sample id and are currently rep1 or rep2
# we want to remove the "rep" with gsub to "R" and iterative using mutate
mutate(replicate = gsub("rep", "R", replicate)) %>%
  
# we are writing over the sample_name col and uniting condition and replicate info 
# into the previous sample_name col. syntax: (data frame - implied from tidy, new_col_name, what to unite)
unite(sample_name, condition, replicate, sep = "_", remove = FALSE)
```

# FINAL cleanup of col names etc.
```{R organizing samplesheet }
samplesheet <- samplesheet %>%
  
  mutate(cell_type = "hepg2",
         condition = gsub("hepg2_", "", condition)) %>%

# final selection of samplesheet info !
  dplyr::select(sample_id, sample_name, replicate, condition,
                cell_type, seq_type, fastq_1, fastq_2, md5sum_1,
                md5sum_2)
```

# That was a lot of work let's save it !
# MAKE SURE TO PUT THIS WHERE WE RUN NF_CORE PIPELINE
```{bash }

# navigate to this path:
cd <your_folder>/CLASS_2023/CLASSES/05_R_analyses/05_RNAseq/00_RNAseq_download_NF_core_pipeline

mkdir 00_NF_CORE_RNAseq_Pipeline_run

# set working directory inside 00_NF_CORE_RNAseq_Pipeline_run

write_csv(samplesheet, "samplesheet.csv")
```


# Now we can easily create the final design file for NF_CORE RNAseq pipeline
The design file needs to be in a specific format (as we saw with nf-core/chipseq)
It needs the following columns:

# sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness
Let's create a sample column using mutate -- and we'll clean up the names

```{r creating design file}
# adding path to fastq files so NF_CORE knows where to get them
base_path <- "/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2023/lucyvk"
fastq_path <- "CLASS_2023/CLASSES/05_R_analyses/05_RNAseq/00_RNAseq_download_NF_core_pipeline/data/fastq2/"
final_path <- c(file.path(base_path, fastq_path))

# There's spaces in the names currently and we need to get rid of those.
design <- samplesheet %>%
  
# we will modify 4 cols adding "sample" and "strandedness"
# We will also add a file path to "fastq_1" and _2 cols
# first changing "sample_name" and adding strandedness col
mutate(sample = gsub(" ", "_", sample_name) %>% tolower(),
         strandedness = "unstranded",
       
# now pasting file path into fastq_1 and _2 cols
         fastq_1 = paste0(final_path, fastq_1),
         fastq_2 = paste0(final_path, fastq_2)) %>%
  
  
  # We aim to retrieve replicate number for sample_id and make it just a number 1 or 2 
  separate(sample_id, into = c("experiment_accession", "replicate"), sep = "_", remove = FALSE) %>%
  
  # getting rid of the rep in front of rep1 and rep2
  mutate(replicate = gsub("rep", "", replicate)) %>%
  
  # Now we gather just the columns we need
  dplyr::select(sample, fastq_1, fastq_2, strandedness)


# getting rid of _r1 and _r2 from sample col
# note we know which replicate is which from fastq col
design <- design %>%
  mutate(sample = gsub("_r1", "", sample),
         sample = gsub("_r2", "", sample))

# let's test that the path to fastq works:
all(sapply(design$fastq_1, file.exists))
all(sapply(design$fastq_2, file.exists))
```

# Now we can write this out for input into nextflow
# NOTE be sure to write this out in 00_NF_CORE_RNAseq_pipeline_run
```{r saving design and samples file}

# write out design.csv
write_csv(design, "design.csv")

# write out samples.csv
write_csv(samples, "samples.csv")

```
# We now have everything we need to do some RNAseq analyses !!

Now we have the raw files downloaded and the samplesheet needed for downstream analyses 
(ex, differential expression). So the next step is to run nf-core/rnaseq on these samples.
We'll do this in the RNAseq II.
