# Loading in all .broadPeak files for all dbps and their replicates

```{r load .broadPeak files}

```

# creating consensus peaks
Using consensus_from_reduced function that requires peak list
and dbp object. This will be done in 2 steps
(1) created dbp object of unique names for dbp
(2) run consensus_from_reduced


```{r create consensus peaks}

  # Creating unique DBP object for create_consensus_peaks_from_reduced
dbp <- unique(sapply(names(peak_list), function(x) {
   unlist(strsplit(x, "_"))[1]
}))

# now run our function consensus_from_reduced
consensus_list <- lapply(dbp, consensus_from_reduced, peak_list)

# adding names to the GRange list
names(consensus_list) <- dbp

save(consensus_list, file = "results/consensus_list.RData")

load("results/consensus_list.RData", verbose = T)
```

# exploring the number of peaks in the consensus_list
```{r exploring number of peaks in consenus peaks}

# creating list of num_peaks per dbp
num_peaks <- sapply(consensus_list, length)

# plotting
hist(num_peaks, breaks = 1000)
hist(num_peaks, breaks = 1000, xlim = c(0,3000))

```
Result: seems like 1000 peaks should be the min moving forward.

# filtering consensus_list to dbps with > 1000 peaks
